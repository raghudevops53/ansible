- name: Print Hello
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Print Hello
      debug:
        msg: "Hello"

    - name: Print Bye
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "Bye"

## Observations:

# 1. Use proper indentations.
# 2. Tasks are the list of activities that ansible perform one by one
# 3. debug is called as module until 2.9 version, from 2.10 version it is been called as collection (ansible.builtin.debug).
# 4. name key is optional and it benefits only to understand what is going on in the command output
# hosts key is mandatory & either tasks / roles is also mandatory.
